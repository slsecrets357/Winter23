V1: lane following + intersection
States:
Lane Following
Approaching Intersection
Waiting at Intersection
Making Turn (Left, Right, Straight)
Exiting Intersection

Transitions:
Lane Following -> Approaching Intersection (Event: Detect Intersection)
Approaching Intersection -> Waiting at Intersection (Event: Stop at Traffic Sign)
Waiting at Intersection -> Making Turn (Event: Turn Signal)
Making Turn -> Exiting Intersection (Event: Completion of Turn)
Exiting Intersection -> Lane Following (Event: Return to Lane Following)

Events:
Detect Intersection
Stop at Traffic Sign
Turn Signal
Completion of Turn
Return to Lane Following

V2: lane following + intersection + pedestrian + overtaking + roundabout

States:
Lane Following
Approaching Intersection
Waiting at Intersection
Making Turn (Left, Right, Straight)
Exiting Intersection
Stopped for Pedestrian
Overtaking Car
Roundabout

Transitions:
Lane Following -> Approaching Intersection (Event: Detect Intersection)
Approaching Intersection -> Waiting at Intersection (Event: Stop at Traffic Sign)
Waiting at Intersection -> Making Turn (Event: Turn Signal)
Making Turn -> Exiting Intersection (Event: Completion of Turn)
Exiting Intersection -> Lane Following (Event: Return to Lane Following)
Lane Following/Approaching Intersection/Waiting at Intersection/Making Turn/Exiting Intersection -> Stopped for Pedestrian (Event: Detect Pedestrian)
Stopped for Pedestrian -> Lane Following (Event: Clear Path)
Lane Following -> overtaking Car (Event: Detect Static Car in Lane)
overtaking Car -> Lane Following (Event: Completion of overtaking)
Lane Following -> Roundabout (Event: Detect Roundabout)
Roundabout -> Lane Following (Event: Exit Roundabout)

Events:
Detect Intersection
Stop at Traffic Sign
Turn Signal
Completion of Turn
Return to Lane Following
Detect Pedestrian
Clear Path
Detect Static Car in Lane
Completion of overtaking
Detect Roundabout
Exit Roundabout

Actions:
Slow down and stop at traffic sign
Check turn signal
Make left turn, right turn, or go straight
Return to lane following speed and behavior
Stop immediately and wait for pedestrian to clear path
Temporarily drive to the left side (if line is dotted) to overtake the static car
Use alternative approach (e.g. GPS, map data, etc.) to control the car until it exits the roundabout

Initial State: Lane Following

Final States: Exiting Intersection (Once turn is completed and the car returns to lane following behavior), Stopped for Pedestrian (if pedestrian is detected and path has not cleared), Lane Following (once the overtaking is completed), or Lane Following (once the car exits the roundabout)

Actions:
Slow down and stop at traffic sign
Check turn signal
Make left turn, right turn, or go straight
Return to lane following speed and behavior

Initial State: Lane Following

Final States: Exiting Intersection (Once turn is completed and the car returns to lane following behavior)
