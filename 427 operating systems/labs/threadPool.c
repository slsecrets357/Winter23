/*
How to handle tasks in a multi threaded manner?

Have a taskqueue from where you retrieve the tasks to be executed on threads.
Have a result queue where you put the results of the tasks you executed.

FLOW:
Create a task.
Submit it to task queue.
Take the tasks from queue and assign it to a thread.
Execute the tasks on thread.
Put the result from each thread to the result queue.
Retrieve it from result queue and print the results to the user.

*/

/*
What is the computation to be executed here?

We will try to estimate the value of pi.

We iterate over a range MAX_iterations.
In each iteration, we find random x and y and then find the square of distance
of point (x,y) from origin. If the distance is less than or equal to 1 then we
increment the count of points lying within the circle. (assuming if a point lies on the circle, it lies within the circle)
We increment the count of points lying within the square in each iteration.
It is assumed that the circle centred on origin has a radius of 0.5 and the square
encompassing the circle has a side of length 1.

Value of pi will be given by - 4.0 * ((double)pCircle / (double)(pSquare))

If works because area of circle to an area of square with side 2r will be in ratio pi/4.
Provided we consider sufficiently large number of points, we can come close to the value of pi. Remember it is estimation not exact value of pi.
*/

/*
What will we do here?

Have say 10,000 iterations to be executed in total.
Break these iterations into tasks consisting of irregular number of iterations.
Add these tasks to the task queue.
Collect the sums from result queue and estimate the value of pi. 
*/

/*

What is interesting about thread pool?

It prevents system from overloading.
We can limit the number of threads being launched.
Either they will be running or waiting.
The pool can be scaled up based on need.
